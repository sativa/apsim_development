<p class="Title2">APSFront</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">APSFront has now been removed from the APSIM release and it's 
development has discontinued. It is recommended that all users migrate to the 
APSIM user interface. Introductory training workshops are held every six months 
and show how to use the new user interface to create and run simulations. 
Alternatively, the same exercises and material can be accessed at
<a href="http://www.apsim.info/apsim/Training/Index.htm">
http://www.apsim.info/apsim/Training/Index.htm</a>. These exercises are self 
paced and assume no knowledge of the APSIM user interface.</p>

<p class="Title2">Run-time speed.</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">Some work has been done on APSIM to improve it's runtime 
speed. While APSIM 5 is almost twice as quick as the previous version 4.2, the 
chart below shows that there is still much to be done to improve APSIM's speed.</p>

<p class="Normal">This chart shows the amount of time, in seconds, that it took 
for APSIM to run a 50 year continuous wheat simulation on the same hardware i.e. 
the changes to runtime speed are due to software and not improved hardware speed 
over the years.</p>
