! MEP 20 Apr 2004  added P Section based on limited data from bean crop at Pescador, Colombia

! Last Change:   JNGH/MJR         26 March 2003 -
!                    Externalisation of phenology after harvest -
!                     	When the crop is harvested, phenology is wound back to a previous stage.
!                          This has been externalised in a table in the ini file.
!                          The table used is defined by two keywords -  stage_code and stage_stem_reduction_harvest.
!                          This allows definition of a new stage to follow harvesting within any phenological stage.
!                    New Kill_stem manager action for severe frosting of perennials -
!                     	A new kill_stem manager action e.g. lucerne kill_stem.
!                          When this action is used, phenology is wound back using a new table specified in the ini file.
!                          The keywords are - stage_code and stage_stem_reduction_kill_stem.
!                          On this action, the regrowth class is read from the ini file, as for a harvest action.
!                    Interpolation of rue against phenological stage -
!                     	Rue is now interpolated from a table read from the ini file.
!                          The table is specified by the two keywords - x_stage_code_rue and  y_rue where y_rue is the rue
!                          at the corresponding stage in x_stage_code_rue. The previous rue keyword is now obsolete.
!                    A new optional cultivar parameter eo_crop_factor has been implemented. This is used to limit the
!                          soilwater demand by the transpiration efficiency method. The limit is calculated as
!                          eo_crop_factor * eo * cover_green. A default (eo_crop_factor_default) is read from the ini file and
!                          is currently to 100 so it is effectively turned off for backwards compatibility.
!                    Unused configuration constants removed -
!                     	X_temp_grain
!                     	Y_grain_rate
!                     	Leaf_app_rate1
!                     	Leaf_app_rate2
!                     	Leaf_no_rate_change
