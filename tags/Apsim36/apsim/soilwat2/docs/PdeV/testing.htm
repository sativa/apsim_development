    <h3> Test procedures</h3>
    <p>
      There are 3 tests included here, and some other miscellaneous
      files that may be useful:
      <ul>
    <li> For posterity, John Dimes' <a href="./test/johndime/">
        soilwat1 </a> runs, from which all the following are
      derived.</li>
    <li> A simple test run to ensure each submodel runs without
      crashing. <a href="./test/simple"> Results </a></li>
    <p></p>
    <li> Starting with a full profile, rain on it to initialise
      1st stage drying. Watch this over the long term to see
      second stage drying, until profile is depleted. <a
        href="./test/longterm"> Results </a>.
        <p><img src="longt.gif">
        </li>
    <li> With the same artificial climate, rain small amounts
      during second stage to watch it switch back to 1st stage. <a
        href="./test/resets"> Results</a>.
        <p><img src="resets.gif">
        </li>
    <li> Compare using a real climate with some measured
      evaporation
      from a
      lysimeter. <a href="./test/observed"> Results</a>.</li>
