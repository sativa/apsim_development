<p class="Normal">APSoil and the soil form in the APSIM User interface has 
undergone numerous changes:</p>
<ul>

export this to/from spreadsheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">The &quot;Check soils&quot; button will now check all soils under the 
currently selected node in the tree rather than all soils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">If you modify DUL, then the PAWC columns are now auto updated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">You can export part of a database to a spreadsheet with path 
info. NB: Path info is now part of the &quot;Name&quot; column in the spreadsheet rather 
than a separate column.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Export some soils to see what I mean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">If you double click on a APSRU-????.soils file, APSoil will 
now check the security and ask for a password if necessary. Didn't before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Some bugs dealing with importing from some .par files have 
been fixed. e.g. TAB characters are now tolerated.</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">When importing values from EXCEL, the precision of those 
numbers is truncated to what the user sees in the APSOIL grid. Previously, 
APSoil was hiding unwanted precision which was causing APSIM problems.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">Apsim user interface</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">Look and feel has changed slightly to improve usability.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">The variables grid now handles a blank module name. e.g. you 
  can specify that you want 'sw' as an output but don't need to provide a source 
  module name for the variable.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">The &quot;Shared&quot; mechanism whereby you can share components 
  between paddocks or simulations now works properly.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">The simulation tree no longer repeatedly expands itself when 
  the user drags or modifies something.</li>

  harvest at flowering&quot; and &quot;Lucerne ley variable sow harvest at flowering&quot;</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">You can now have an if statement on the very first line of a 
  logic component. Previously this would stop APSIM running.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">APSIM Report</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">New components: ChartLine, Depth, Frequency, RecFilter and

<p class="Title2">Infrastructure</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">The APSIM infrastructure is now more CMP (Common Modelling 
Protocol) compliant meaning that APSIM modules now stand a much better chance of 
running in CSIRO Plant Industry's FARMWI$E grazing framework and visa versa.</p>

<p class="Title2">APSFront</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">APSFront has now been removed from the APSIM release and it's 
development has discontinued. It is recommended that all users migrate to the 
APSIM user interface. Introductory training workshops are held every six months 
and show how to use the new user interface to create and run simulations. 
Alternatively, the same exercises and material can be accessed at
<a href="http://www.apsim.info/apsim/Training/Index.htm">
http://www.apsim.info/apsim/Training/Index.htm</a>. These exercises are self 
paced and assume no knowledge of the APSIM user interface.</p>

<p class="Title2">Sorghum</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">A new Sorghum module makes it's debut in this release. No 
changes are required to the control / parameter files to use this new module.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Run-time speed.</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">Some work has been done on APSIM to improve it's runtime 
speed. While APSIM 5 is almost twice as quick as the previous version 4.2, the 
chart below shows that there is still much to be done to improve APSIM's speed.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Title2">
<img border="0" src="runtime%20speed%205.gif" width="753" height="621"></p>

<p class="Normal">This chart shows the amount of time, in seconds, that it took 
for APSIM to run a 50 year continuous wheat simulation on the same hardware i.e. 
the changes to runtime speed are due to software and not improved hardware speed 
over the years.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Apsim user interface</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">Support for complex rotations has been added, similar to the 
way APSFront did rotations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">Grid cell handling has been improved so that 
cut/copy/paste/delete works in the same way as Microsoft Excel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">A new memo/comment facility has been added so that users can 
add comments to their simulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">A new tracker capability has been added so that APSIM 
variables can be summarised e.g. average weekly/monthly rainfall, runoff etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">A new erosion capability has been added.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">Increased stability and a new look.</p>

</ul>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Screen</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">The screen module no longer exists. All control files will be 
automatically modified to remove the reference to screen. e.g. lines like the 
following will be deleted.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
