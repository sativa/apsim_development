<p class="Title1">The APSIM Peanut Module -(peanut)</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Introduction</p>
<p class="Normal">The peanut module was developed Michael Robertson with contributions of data from Graeme Wright, RCN Rao and Mike Bell (QDPI Kingaroy). The module was developed from the original QNUT model (Hammer et al. 1995) with numerous enhancements. The module is described in the paper by Robertson et al. (2002). The reader is referred to the science document for the plant module for a comprehensive description of the processes simulated by APSIM-Peanut. This document outlines some peanut-specific issues that are not covered by the plant science document. </p>
<p class="Normal">Notable features of APSIM-PEANUT</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The phenology of peanut cultivars are responsive to temperature and photoperiod, but not vernalisation. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Account is taken of the energy costs involved in synthesising the high energy content grain in peanut. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Oil content is not simulated dynamically in response to any cultivar or environmental effects. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">APSIM-peanut is not phosphorus-responsive, this is currently under development. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Crop growth is not sensitive to waterlogging. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">The module does not simulate the differences between bunch and runner types in terms of canopy expansion and indeterminacy. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">Cultivars and crop classes</p>
<p class="Normal">There is one crop class.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">There are 9 cultivars able to be simulated: Early bunch, Virginia bunch, Streeton, McCubbin, Chico , NC7, VB97, Florunner, Condor. Cultivars differ in terms of biomass partitioning to grain and phenology. </p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Validation</p>
<p class="Normal">APSIM-Peanut has received testing across northern Australia , with factors such as cultivars, sowing date, irrigation, soil type, plant population density row spacing varying. Papers describing validation of APSIM-Peanut are by Robertson et al. (1998) and Robertson et al. (2002). The accompanying figure demonstrates the performance of the module against Australian datasets.</p>
