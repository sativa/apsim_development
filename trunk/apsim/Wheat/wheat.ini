!PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RADIATION USE EFFICIENCY (RUE)
!%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
!STAGE DEPENDENT RUE  - The following rue values were used in i_wheat (Meinke et al, 1998)

!according to Jamieson et al (1998) (Sirus model) maximum rue for PAR ranges from 2.2-2.5 g/Mj, which corresponds to a rue for
!total radiation of 1.1-1.25, so the i_wheat value is a bit higher than these values
 
!In NWHEAT the RUE for tops is determined by:  ce_tops = min(2.0, 3.8*divide(g_radn**0.63, g_radn, 0.0))
!So RUE can be even higher than 1.34 (I_WHEAT) and is related to solar radiation, it ranges from 3.8-1.1 for global solar
!radiation range of 1.0-30.0 mj/m2

!RUE increases as the proportion of diffuse radiation within the canopy increases. This proportion will increase at lower
!sun angles and therefore, on average, will be larger at high vs. low latitude, or on overcast vs. clear days

!Meinke's experiment indicated that Neither nitrogen nor water levels affected RUE, it was constant 1.34 for all water and n treatments

!LAI DETERMINED - USED AS DEFAULT OPTION
!The origninal i_wheat approach uses lai and stage to determine extinct_coeff.

!After anthesis k = 0.42

!K value can increase after ear emergence as a result of light interception of ears.

!Some experiments indicated incease of
!k after anthesis (like nwheat), but this might be due to the rapid leaf senescence and subsequent interception by senesed
!material. It appears appropriate to ignore this apparent increase in k after anthesis and thus ignore the unproductive light
!interception by senesced material (Meinke, 1997)
!

!TEMPERATURE RESPONSE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS - RUE

!The template version uses the daily average temperature, we should use the daytime temperature ???
x_ave_temp      = 0  10 25 35 (oC)   ! ew - from literature van Keulen & Seligman, 1987

!y_stress_photo  = 0  1  1  0  ()

!In nwheat daytime temperature is used as the following equation to calculate stress_photo
!This gives a minimum, opt and max temperature of -2, 18 and 38C (daytime)
!f=1-0.0025*(Tday-18)*(Tday-18), and if mint<-4, f=0, no photosynthesis occurs.

!The extraction front velocity (mm d-1) typically ranges from 14 to 21 mm d-1 for winter crops. this depends largely on
!whether a lag phase (i.e. no root extension until x days after sowing) is considered or if root extension starts on the
!day of germination.  i_wheat assumes root extention to start at germination and the value for ef_rate is hence at the
!lower end of expected values. the value used here is from the same experiment (APS15) as the kl values. on sandy soils
!I would expect this value to be slightly higher, while corresponding kl values would be slightly lower (MEINKE).
