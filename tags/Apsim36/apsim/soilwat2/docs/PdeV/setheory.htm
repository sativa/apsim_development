<H3>Background Soil Evaporation Theory</H3>

<P>All these models are derived from the earliest parametric model of (Black,
1969 - &quot;The prediction of evaporation, drainage and soil water storage
for a bare soil&quot;, S<I>oil Science society of America Journal </I>33:655-660)
that describes cumulative actual evaporation (Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>)) during
a drying cycle as </P>

<P>Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>) = a<SUB>1</SUB> t<SUP>1/2</SUP></P>

<P>Where a1 is a parameter describing the evaporation process (mm/day),
and t is the time in days after preceding rainfall. </P>

<P>This does not take into account staged evaporation, which ritchie (1972)
describes as </P>

<UL>
<P>Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>) = Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>) for t &lt;= t<SUB>1</SUB>
in which Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>) &lt;= Sum(E<SUB>1</SUB>)</P>

<P>Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>) = Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>) + a<SUB>2</SUB> (t-t<SUB>1</SUB>)<SUP>1/2</SUP>
for t &gt; t<SUB>1</SUB></P>
</UL>

<P>in which Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>) is the cumulative potential evaporation
during a drying cycle (mm), t1 is the duration of stage 1, Sum(E<SUB>1</SUB>)
is the cumulative actual evaporation at the end of stage 1, and a2 is a
parameter (derived from experimental data?). </P>
