<p class="Title1">APSIM<b><sup>4.0</sup></b> release notes</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">10<sup>th</sup> Dec 2004</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">APSIM version 4 is a major release with many changes and
enhancements.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Title2">Documentation</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">All APSIM documentation has been recomposed to HTML format, and
is available under the APSIM4 icon on your desktop and on the web at
<a href="http://www.apsim.info">www.apsim.info</a>.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">APSoil</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">APSoil has been reworked as a soil characterisation database
capable of holding all soil numbers that APSIM requires. Soils can be created,
edited and copied and pasted between databases. The soils can then be used from
APSFront and from the new APSIM User Interface.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">ApsimUI</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Starting with version 4.0, a new user interface is being
released. This interface provides full access to all APSIM functionality and
will ultimately replace APSFront. To learn more about the interface and see some
screen shots goto the APSIM User Interface Documentation.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">Plant</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal"> Internal changes to plant phenology (both legumes &amp; wheat)
have resulted in (mostly minor) changes to plant development, with subsequent changes to
biomass production / leaf area / N uptake.</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Several defects to do with the water use efficiency
calculations in the plant module have now been fixed.</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">A P defect is fixed - when SoilP was plugged in, there was no
water uptake.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">Peanut</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">There have been changes to the pod-filling process
under water stress, as well as changes to Indian cultivars.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">SurfaceOM, Residue2 and Manure</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">SurfaceOM replaces the old APSIM Residue2 and APSIM Manure as
the module responsible for modelling the surface organic material present in a
simulation. This new module contains numerous new features, including the
ability to keep track of the fate of individual components in the surface matter
mix (ie old wheat residues and new lucerne residues), the ability to specify
different C:N and C:P ratios in each of the fresh organic matter pools
(carbohydrate, cellulose, and lignin) for any individual residue, as well as
retaining the old capacity to consider all the surface materials as a single
entity, if desired. The new SurfaceOM module now facilitates more realistic
modelling of crop residues in rotations, forest floor mulches (consisting of
sticks, twigs, leaves etc – each with very different physical and chemical
characteristics), and the use of manures in agriculture. For more information,
please see the SURFACEOM science documentation. The changes required to the control and
parameters files are made automatically when you run your simulation.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">Solute</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Several new output variables are now available in the APSIM
Solute module. These allow the user to report the soil layer with the greatest
concentration of any particular solute, and the corresponding amount of that
solute in either parts per million (ppm) or kilograms per hectare (kg/ha).</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">Watersupply</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">APSIM Watersupply now has the capacity to specify the runoff
characteristics of a catchment in terms of the catchment area (ha) and a
catchment_runoff_factor (based on the USDA curve-number method). See
documentation for more details. This feature is used to provide a simplified
model for incoming surface water to a sump or dam, and may augment the capture
of runoff from the simulated cropping area in situations where this is required.
Several new output variables are also available in APSIM4, specifically relating
to statistics on dam levels and dam filling events. See WaterSupply documentation for more details.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">SWIM</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Apswim is now capable of simulating soil profiles which
include subsurface drains. The Hooghoudt drainage algorithm from DrainMod can
now be used to provide a sink term for water and solutes at a given depth. A new
bottom boundary condition has also been added to help better describe situations
where the soil profile is interacting with a regional water table. For more
information on either of these, refer to the apswim science documentation.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">SoilN2</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Temperature factors for decomposition have been changed to
better handle frozen soil conditions.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">Ozcot, PigeonP and Millet</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">These three modules are now included as part of the standard
release. When using these modules, acknowledgement should be given to CSIRO
Plant Industry, Narrabri for OZCOT and ICRISAT for PigeonP and Millet.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">Sorghum</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Several defects relating to N balance in Sorghum have been
fixed.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Title2">Stock</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">The CSIRO Plant Industry <i>STOCK</i> module is now compatible
with APSIM. To use STOCK in APSIM, please contact Andrew Moore, CSIRO Plant
Industry, Canberra to obtain a licence for <i>Farmwi$e</i>. </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Once <i>Farmwi$e</i> is installed, the stock.dll can be copied
to the apsim/stock/lib directory.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
