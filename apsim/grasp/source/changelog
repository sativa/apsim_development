Changelog 24/3/98 PdeV.

      SWIM interface (this was previously submitted 11/97 but went missing)
Grasp can use SWIM for its water balance. There are 2 new parameters:

uptake_source = 'apsim' or 'calc'      ! Who calculates water uptake
kl2rlv        = 0.0                    ! Converts kl() to rlv for swim

     Reporting growth_regrow(th)
A bug was removed in reporting growth_regrowth.

     EP facility
Grasp can do Erosion Productivity simulations by increasing N stress as the profile erodes. This means more parameters:

max_n_avail_dist = 0.8  0.15 0.05     ! N distribution over profile
enr_a_coeff = 0.0                     ! enrichment coefficients in N lost
enr_b_coeff = 0.0                     ! in sediment

Note that max_n_avail is now associated with root_depth, in that the sum of N available to plants is that which can be extracted by roots.
