(The only reference to this method known so far is in "Soil Water
    Balance Model : WATSUP", K.G. Rickert and G.M.McKeon,
    <i>Proc. Aust. Soc. Anim. Prod</i>, 1982 vol 14.), but the GRASP
    implementation is significantly different. This page describes the
    GRASP implementation, which can be found in "GRASP: Grass
    Production Model", McKeon et al, QDPI, 1993.)

<h4> Ken Rickert's soil evaporation model. </h4>

    <p> This model may only be of interest to those wishing to run
      APSGRASP with a similar water balance to that used by McKeon. 
    </p>
    <p> Soil evaporation (ES) from layers 1 and 2 depends on the relative
      ability of either layer to meet the evaporative demand. The top
      layer can dry to airdry, whereas the second layer dries to ll15.
    </p>
    <p> Each layer has a supply ratio (SI) that determines the amount of
      soil water the soil can provide for evaporation. 
      <ul> 
	 ES<sub>k</sub> = SI<sub>k</sub> * EOS
      </ul>
      where EOS is calculated elsewhere. 
    </p><p>
      The supply ratio for the top layer is given by
      <ul> 
	SI<sub>1</sub> = 0.285 * AWR<sub>1</sub> / (1.0 - 0.715 *
	AWR<sub>1</sub> )
      </ul>
      where 
      <ul>
	AWR<sub>i</sub> is the available water ratio calculated with
	air dry values (AWR = (SW - AD)/(FC - AD)), and<br>
	  0.285 is a magic number determined
	  experimentally (?).
      </ul>
      For the second layer, SI<sub>2</sub> is calculated by the
      difference between the supply ratio for both layers 1 and 2, and
      SI<sub>1</sub>. 
    </p><p>
      <ul> 
	SI<sub>12</sub> = 0.117 * AWR<sub>12</sub> / (1.0 - 0.883 *
	AWR<sub>12</sub> )
      </ul> 
      where 
<pre> 
        SW1 + SW2 - AD1 - AP2
AWR12 = ---------------------
        FC1 + FC2 - AD1 - WP2
</pre>
      so 
      <ul> 
	SI<sub>2</sub> = SI<sub>12</sub> - SI<sub>1</sub>
      </ul> 
    </p><p>
    The total daily soil evaporation is limited by a parameter
    <tt>max_evap</tt>, ie
    <ul>
      ES<sub>1</sub> + ES<sub>2</sub> &lt;= max_evap
    </ul>
    </p><p>
       A warning message will
      appear if total soil evaporation exceeds available soil water.
    </p>
    <hr> 
      <p> Note that McKeon's implementation allows the second layer to
	evaporate to the plant's wilting point, unlike the top layer
	which can dry to airdry. Is this a property of the evaporation
	process, or a reflection that he doesn't have airdry for the
	lower layers in his model?
