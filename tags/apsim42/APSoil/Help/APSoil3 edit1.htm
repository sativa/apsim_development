&nbsp; </P>
<P>APSoil3 enables the user to store and present 'paddock level' soil resource information in forms suitable for presentation and use in simulation modelling. The program enables the inputting of field data and the calculation of available soil water and nitrogen based on known soil characteristics, including bulk density and plant available water capacity. The user has the choice of using soil characteristics developed by researchers for a wide range of soils of Australia's northern cropping region or may elect to input and base results on their own characteristics. APSoil3 provides the capability to develop a soil database for particular farms and paddocks which may be used to compare resource usage over time. </P>
<P>Whilst APSoil3 provides a means of presenting data in a form useful in presentation and discussion, it should be noted that 'best practice' in soil monitoring underlies the use of this program. It is recommended that this program be used in conjunction with the manual <I>Soil matters-monitoring soil water and nutrients in dryland farming (Dalgliesh and Foale 1998)</I> which is available in written form or at <A HREF="file:///A|/www.farmscape.tag.csiro.au">www.farmscape.tag.csiro.au</A>. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="#characterisation"><B>Soil Characterisation</B></A> module allows you to select a soil type, from the APSRU database, that best represents your sampling location or to create new soil characteristics based on your own data. It is also possible to create sampling profiles to suit your particular sampling needs. </P>
<P>The <A HREF="#Samples"><B>Samples</B></A> module is used to input the data you collect from the field. The sample data is stored according to the name of the farmer, the farm, the paddock and the date that sampling took place. </P>
<P>The <A HREF="#Results"><B>Results</B></A><B> </B>module presents the field data as available water and nitrogen based on the selected soil characteristics and depth layers. </P>
<P>The <A HREF="#Graphs"><B>Graph</B></A><B> </B>module presents the available water and nitrogen in two separate graphs, one for Soil Water, and one for Soil Nitrate. You can edit the graphs to suit your requirements and/or print them for a hard copy. </P>
<B><P>Help</B> provides links to the <A HREF="file:///S:/deneh/APSoil Files/www.farmscape.tag.csiro.au">FARMSCAPE</A> web site, which has current updates and user manuals, and contact details for CSIRO/APSRU. It also provides a link to this user manual.</P>

<P>The <B>Results </B>module presents the water and nitrogen measured in the field as available water and nitrogen, as determined using the soil characteristics selected. The top half of the screen displays the selected soil characteristic, the bottom half, the calculated available water and nitrogen. Available water and nitrogen will change as different soil characteristics are selected. Unless crop lower limit information is an available characteristic, available water and nitrogen will not be displayed and the bottom half of the screen will remain blank. </P>
<P>Click on the <B>Results </B>option </P>
<I><P>…You will see… </I>a results form. The toolbar has buttons for printing the results and presenting them in APSIM compatible form. The screen is split horizontally into two with a tree and display table in each. </P><IMG SRC="resultsa.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=546 HEIGHT=368>
<P>The top tree enables selection of the appropriate soil characteristic, drilling down through database/region/town and /crop. Both the APSRU and users databases may be accessed. </P>
<P>The bottom tree enables selection of the field data for calculation. Default displayed data is whatever was selected last (during the current APSoil session) in the <B>Samples</B> module, thus enabling data to be inputted, calculations undertaken and graphing done without having to re-select field data. <BR>

<P>Data is presented as: </P>

<UL>
<LI>water available in the profile for the crop selected (in depth of water in mm-may be thought of the same way as rainfall) </LI>

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What if the sampling intervals that I used during sampling are different to those in the soil characteristic database?</B></FONT> </P>
<P>APSoil is designed to interpolate data where samples have been taken at different intervals to those used in the characterisation database eg. 0-10, 10-60, 60 to 90cm compared to 0-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-90 cm., recalculating the various soil parameters (BD, DUL and CLL) at the actual depths of sampling. This information is then used in both tabular and graphical presentation. </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>To Generate APSIM Files</B></FONT> </P>
<P>Clicking on the <B>Generate APSIM Files</B> button on the <B>Results</B> toolbar allows data in APSIM compatible format to be generated from the data currently on the screen. Data available for transfer to APSIM files will depend on what soil information is included in the APSoil database but can include DUL, SAT, CLL, current soil water, bulk density, organic carbon, pH and current nitrate N. At present APSIM compatible data has to be transferred manually to the actual APSIM soil files, using cut and paste. To ensure that all data being used for simulation is presented using the same sampling intervals, sampling data (current soil water and nitrate) is re-calculated to the standard layer intervals used in the Soil Characterisation database (generally 0-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-90, 90-120, 120-150, 150-180). In the case where overall sampling depth is shallower than the soil characterisation information, sampling data is only presented to the depth available.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5><P><A NAME="Graphs"></A>Graphs</B></FONT> </P>
<P>This module allows presentation of available water and nitrogen in graphical form. </P>
<P>Click on the <B>Graphs </B>option </P>
<I><P>…You will see… </I>a graphs form. The toolbar has buttons for printing and editing the graphs. The screen will show three tree displays (on the left) and two graphs: <BR>
&nbsp; </P><IMG SRC="graphs.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=531 HEIGHT=343>
<P><BR>
The top tree display allows selection of the appropriate soil characteristic drilling down through database/region/town and /crop. <BR>
The middle tree enables selection of the paddock to be graphed. </P>
<P>The bottom tree shows all dates on which the selected paddock has been sampled and allows selection of one or more of these dates for presentation. </P>
<P>The <B>soil water </B>graph shows the drained upper limit and crop lower water limit and the actual water content at the time of sampling. </P>
<P>The <B>soil nitrate </B>graph shows the available nitrate in the soil sample. <BR>
Total available water and nitrogen are shown at the bottom of each graph. </P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>NB: Nitrate N is presented in kg/ha for each layer and where wide sampling intervals are used (for example 60 or 90cm) may result in the appearance of N bulges in some depth layers. Although it is not possible to know the distribution of nitrate in more detail (unless analyses are undertaken using shorter depth intervals eg 15 or 30cm), it is reasonable to assume that it is distributed more evenly than this type of presentation would appear to show. Care should be taken when interpreting these graphs to ensure that users understand that what appear to be large concentrations of nitrate may only be caused by the layer thickness being used.</P>
</FONT><P>You can compare the results of two samples from the same paddock taken on different dates by selecting more than one date in the bottom tree display. This will display the results from both samples on each graph. </P>
<P>Comments may be entered in the box below the graphs before printing, however, these comments will not be saved when you move on to another module or close APSoil. </P>
