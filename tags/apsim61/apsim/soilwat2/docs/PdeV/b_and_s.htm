(This draws from the paper "Simple model for daily evaporation from
    fallow tilled soil under spring conditions in a temperate
    climate", J.J.T.I Boesten and L. Stroosnijder, <i>Netherlands
      Journal of Agricultural Science</i> 34 (1986) 75-90.)
<H3>The B&amp;S model</H3>

<P>B&amp;S developed a &quot;simple parametric model&quot; to estimate
daily evaporation from fallow tilled soil under spring conditions in a
temperate climate, in which E<SUB>pot</SUB> varies from 1 to 6 mm/day.
Their &quot;equation 4&quot; that describes soil evaporation is:</P>

<UL>
<P>Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>) = Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>) for Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>)
&lt; B<SUP>2</SUP></P>

<P>Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>) = Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>) for Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>)
= Sum(E<SUB>1</SUB>) = B<SUP>2 </SUP></P>

<P>Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>) = B.Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>)<SUP>1/2</SUP> for Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>)
&gt; B<SUP>2 </SUP></P>
</UL>

<P>in which B (mm<SUP>1/2</SUP>) is the evaporation characteristic soil
parameter to be determined experimentally. In this equation, Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>)
is not dependant on time. </P>

<P>The two options A and B refer to how the model responds to conditions
where daily rainfall excess (rainfall - E<SUB>pot</SUB>) is not sufficient
to to moisten the dried soil profile to field capacity, ie how the
      "resets" are implemented. </P>

<H4>Option A</H4>

<P>Option A assumes that at any time the deficit in soil water throughout
the soil profile determines actual evaporation. The procedure is: </P>

<P>On days of no excess rainfall, (rainfall &lt; E<SUB>pot</SUB>), Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>)
and also E<SUB>act</SUB> is calculated from the updated value of Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>)
by </P>

<UL>
<P>(Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>))<SUB>n</SUB> = (Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>))<SUB>n-1</SUB>+
(E<SUB>pot</SUB> - rainfall)<SUB>n</SUB></P>
</UL>

<P>in which index <i>n</i> is the day number. (Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>))<SUB>n</SUB>
is calculated from (Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>))<SUB>n</SUB> by equation 4, and
(E<SUB>act</SUB>)<SUB>n</SUB> is calculated by </P>

<UL>
<P>(E<SUB>act</SUB>)<SUB>n</SUB> = (rainfall)<SUB>n</SUB> + (Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>))<SUB>n</SUB>
- (Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>))<SUB>n-1</SUB> </P>
</UL>

<P>On days of excess in rainfall (rainfall &gt; E<SUB>pot</SUB>), </P>

<UL>
<P>(E<SUB>act</SUB>)<SUB>n</SUB> = (E<SUB>pot</SUB>)<SUB>n</SUB> </P>
</UL>

<P>and the excess of infiltration is subtracted from Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>):
</P>

<UL>
<P>(Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>))<SUB>n</SUB> = (Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>))<SUB>n-1</SUB>
- (rainfall - E<SUB>pot</SUB>)<SUB>n</SUB> </P>
</UL>

<P>Thereafter, Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>))<SUB>n</SUB> is calculated from Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>))<SUB>n</SUB>
with equation 4. If daily rainfall excess greater than Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>))<SUB>n-1</SUB>,
then both Sum(E<SUB>act</SUB>))<SUB>n</SUB> and Sum(E<SUB>pot</SUB>))<SUB>n</SUB>
are set to zero. </P>

<H4>Option B</H4>

<P>
Option B differs in that Sum(E<sub>act</sub>) is always set to zero if
      there is an excess in rainfall. Calculation of E<sub>act</sub>
      in the subsequent drying cycle is described above by equation
      4, up until all water from this rainfall has been
      evaporated. Then, Sum(E<sub>act</sub>) jumps to the value which
      it had just before the rainfall. 
</P>
<p> Option B implies that excess in rainfall remains in the upper soil
      layers at FC and is not redistributed in the drier deeper
      layers. 
</p>

<H4>Andy Smith's Option B</H4>
    <p>
      Andy left a modified option B with no documentation. I've left this
      model in, but have doubts as to its usefulness, certainly it's
      doing some wierd things.
