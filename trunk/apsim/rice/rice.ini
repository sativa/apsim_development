!from air temperature (Meinke, 1997; Jamieson' Sirus, 1998). Assuming a normal sowing depth of 50-80mm and a shoot_lag of

!####From Ceres Rice

!In the current version themal time is calculated using 3hr crown temperature estimated from daily maximum/minimum crown temp
!The phenology part of the wheat model will be upgrated to a new approach based on leaf development soon
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!LEAF NUMBER DEVELOPMENT 

!currently leaf number at emergence will affect LAI at early stage, leaf_no_seed has no effect on the model, but will have in future

leaf_no_at_emerg = 0.5     ! (expanded) leaf number at emergence ()
!###Is this new leaves produced from germination to emergence or leaf no. at emergence? Documentation a little confusing.
!###Yoshida states that first leaf emerges when coleoptile 1cm long. Assuming SD of 1-2 cm, wheat value of 0.5 seems reasonable.
!###Yoshida figure may not be correct interpretation.

leaf_no_seed     = 3.5     ! number of leaf primordia present in seed (at emergence?) <-  THIS WILL AFFECT THE FLAG LEAF STAGE in future
!###Dont understand this??? Is leaf no. at emergence one of these seed primordia??

leaf_no_min      = 4.0  ()            ! minimum leaf number
!###Presumably this is the sum of leaf no. at emergence and seed leaf number.
!leaf_no_max      = 40.0 ()            ! maximum leaf number
leaf_no_max      = 20.0 ()            ! maximum leaf number
!###Is this the maximum number on the main culm?
!###Likely to be less for rice ~20 seems to be a commonly quoted figure.

!Leaf_init_rate will be read, but it does not have any effect on the model currently, but
!the leaf initiation rate will affect phenoly in the next version

leaf_init_rate   = 70  (oCd) ! 95     ! degree days to initiate each leaf primordium until floral init (deg day)
!###This refers to the rate of leaf primordia appearance (below refers to appearance of fully expanded leaves).


!Leaf_app_rate1 and 2 are used in the phenology calculation
!scc Should we modify these (rather than phenology routines) by N and water stress,
!or at least by these via biomass supply

!leaf_app_rate1      = 95.0 (oCd)       ! Growing deg day required to develop the most leaf ligules. (deg day).
!leaf_app_rate2      = 95.0 (oCd)       ! Growing deg day required to develop last leaf ligules. (deg day).
!leaf_no_rate_change = 3    ()          ! Leaf no below flag above which leaf appearance rate changes from rate1 to rate2.
                                       ! RELATIVE to FLAG

leaf_app_rate1      = 100.0 (oCd)       ! Growing deg day required to develop the most leaf ligules. (deg day).
leaf_app_rate2      = 170.0 (oCd)       ! Growing deg day required to develop last leaf ligules. (deg day).
leaf_no_rate_change = 9    ()          ! Leaf no below flag above which leaf appearance rate changes from rate1 to rate2.
                                       ! RELATIVE to FLAG

!###Can we set up three as for CARICE??
!###CARICE uses 38.5dd (0-3 leaves), 58.8dd (4-PI) and 161.3dd (thereafter). Note these are based on 10Tb. Make PI leaf number 10??.
!###Yoshida quotes 100dd prior to PI and 170dd thereafter.
!### Need to check this estimate of leaf number at PI 
!###Need to confirm leaf changeover number

!###Rice values taken from Sinclair and Horie (1.4 for vegetative), Hasegawa and Horie (RUE declines by 0.5 from PI to maturity).
!### Note that this is a stepwise relationship. ie 0.8 through to maturity (stage 10)
!### Chech the reason for this decline - unusual according to Mike.
!### Lilley figures were 3.1 to flowering and 0.4 thereafter based on PAR. Half of these figures is reasonably in agreement with published figures.
!according to Jamieson et al (1998) (Sirus model) maximum rue for PAR ranges from 2.2-2.5 g/Mj, which corresponds to a rue for
!total radiation of 1.1-1.25, so the i_wheat value is a bit higher than these values
 
!In NWHEAT the RUE for tops is determined by:  ce_tops = min(2.0, 3.8*divide(g_radn**0.63, g_radn, 0.0))
!So RUE can be even higher than 1.34 (I_WHEAT) and is related to solar radiation, it ranges from 3.8-1.1 for global solar
!radiation range of 1.0-30.0 mj/m2

!RUE increases as the proportion of diffuse radiation within the canopy increases. This proportion will increase at lower
!sun angles and therefore, on average, will be larger at high vs. low latitude, or on overcast vs. clear days

!Meinke's experiment indicated that Neither nitrogen nor water levels affected RUE, it was constant 1.34 for all water and n treatments

!EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT BEFORE ANTHESIS

!LAI DETERMINED - USED AS DEFAULT OPTION
!The origninal i_wheat approach uses lai and stage to determine extinct_coeff.
!In nwheat before grain filling extinct_coeff = 0.6, during grain filling extinct_coeff =0.7

!The following relationship is based on Holger's experiment (Meinke et al, 1998)
!x_extinct_coeff_lai  = 0.00  0.10  0.20  0.30  0.40  0.50  0.60  0.70  0.80  0.90  1.00  10.0    ()  !LAI

y_extinct_coeff_lai  = 0.40  0.40  0.60 0.60   ()  !extinction coefficient for green leaf

!###Extinction coefficient from ORYZA1 is 0.4 when lai<1.5 and pre-flowering. 0.6 thereafter 
!###Variable with cultivar - investigate cv specific values??

!After anthesis k = 0.42

!extinct_coeff_post_anthesis = 0.42

extinct_coeff_post_anthesis = 0.60
!###As for final setting above. Above is just up until flowering and not beyond

!K value can increase after ear emergence as a result of light interception of ears.

!Some experiments indicated incease of
!k after anthesis (like nwheat), but this might be due to the rapid leaf senescence and subsequent interception by senesed
!material. It appears appropriate to ignore this apparent increase in k after anthesis and thus ignore the unproductive light
!interception by senesced material (Meinke, 1997)
!

x_ave_temp      = 0 5  15 35 50  (oC)
y_stress_photo  = 0 0   1  1  0  ()
!###Needs To be explored further for rice. Set as for sugar

!In nwheat daytime temperature is used as the following equation to calculate stress_photo
!This gives a minimum, opt and max temperature of -2, 18 and 38C (daytime)
!f=1-0.0025*(Tday-18)*(Tday-18), and if mint<-4, f=0, no photosynthesis occurs.

!###Lilley observed no further root growth shortly after floral initiation. Others have noted root growth up to flowering
!###Lilley has water uptake in chapter 3 down to 1-1.1m. Adjusted root depth rate to get this

!The extraction front velocity (mm d-1) typically ranges from 14 to 21 mm d-1 for winter crops. this depends largely on
!whether a lag phase (i.e. no root extension until x days after sowing) is considered or if root extension starts on the
!day of germination.  i_wheat assumes root extention to start at germination and the value for ef_rate is hence at the
!lower end of expected values. the value used here is from the same experiment (APS15) as the kl values. on sandy soils
