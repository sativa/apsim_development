!However in exp 3 and Gatton Sep planting, Bange got an LAR of ca. 24 and LIR of 12!
!This suggests that low radiation/cool temps (low carbon supply) "speeds up" leaf appearance

!Last revised by SCC April 30 1998
!JOB for ENLI - work out why you can't have tt_flag_to_flower = 0
!seems to be a problem in leaf area or biomass routines, not phenology

!SCC 20/10/99 Used separate tpla parameters for each cultivar - recomputed for ttbase = 4
!Not that to connect the leaf area and phenology routines, we really have to use tt_emerg_budvis
!as the tpla_inflection point (or something ca. halfway to flowering).

!General principles for modelling phenology and leaf area of sunflower
! 1. Leaf appearance rate differs with cultivar. It is not practical to try to adjust this
! for all new cultivars. Hence, while we try to model bud visible date and use leaf initiation
! rate to estimate final leaf number, we don't try to use leaf appearance rate to drive
! the time from emergence to flowering. It's a bit of a nightmare.....
! 2. Leaf area continues to increase beyond 1st anthesis (in fact seems to continue for
! a week to 10d. i.e. until 50% anthesis or even 90% anthesis. End of leaf growth should really
! be at anthesis (or even at start grain-fill....)
! The effect is that the inflection point for leaf area is between 0.63 and 0.66 of the thermal time
! between emergence and the end of leaf area expansion (flowering). This is what we use now.
