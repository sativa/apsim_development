<p class="title2">Purpose</p>

<p class="Normal"><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class="Normal">Calculate values of annual average ambient temperature (TAV) 
and annual amplitude in mean monthly temperature (AMP) for an APSIM climate 
(met) file and insert these values with keywords into the file.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2"><br>
Introduction</p>
<p class="Normal"><br>
Apsim-SoilN2 (SoilN2) model uses the TAV and AMP to calculate the daily soil 
temperature for a site. These two variables are read by SoilN2 from its site 
parameter file and are used as default values for the site. If SoilN2 is unable 
to obtain these values from another APSIM module, such as the Met or Manager 
modules, it will use these default values. Tav_Amp has been constructed to 
calculate and insert the TAV and AMP values into the keyword portion of an APSIM 
climate file so that the Met module can provide these values on request by 
SoilN2. Tav_Amp is a Lahey Fortran90 program compiled and linked to for 32 bit 
operation.<br>
&nbsp;<p class="Title2">
<br>
Description<p class="Normal"><br>
Amp is obtained by averaging the mean daily temperature of each month over the 
entire data period resulting in twelve mean temperatures, and then subtracting 
the minimum of these values from the maximum. Tav is obtained by averaging the 
twelve mean monthly temperatures.<br>
<br>
Tav_Amp reads a nominated met file, calculates the values for TAV and AMP and 
writes a new met file with the calculated values inserted after the TAV and AMP 
keywords, which are placed immediately before the column headers. A comment is 
inserted before these new lines which specifies the date and time of insertion 
and the start and end of the period over which the data is calculated. Any 
existing TAV and AMP keyword and comment lines are removed. Ambient temperature 
is calculated by averaging the maximum and minimum temperatures of the day. 
Before reading the temperature data columns, the column headers are identified 
by the text strings, year, maxt and mint which are not within a comment. <br>
Tav_Amp is run from a DOS prompt or the Windows Run command and requires the 
input and output file names to be specified after ‘Tav_Amp’.<br>
&nbsp;<p class="Title2"><br>
Requirements<p class="Normal"><br>
Tav_Amp is a MSDOS based program written in Fortran 90, linked as a 32 bit 
windows executable. It is currently compiled to use a maths co-processor. It 
requires the input file to have at least 4 data columns, headed with the text 
names of year, day, maxt and mint. A units line is expected to immediately 
follow this header line. There are no requirements for the lines preceding the 
header line. There must be at least one data line following the units line. All 
comments are ignored. The column headers and data values must be separated by at 
least one blank.<br>
<br>
Use<br>
Syntax:<br>
<br>
Tav_Amp [drive:][path]input_filename [drive:][path]output_filename<br>
<br>
where:<br>
[drive:][path]input_filename - <br>
the name of the input file and optionally its path, up to 255 characters 
including the path.<br>
<br>
[drive:][path]output_filename - <br>
the name of the output file and optionally its path, up to 255 characters 
including the path.<br>
Eg.<br>
Tav_Amp dalby.met dalby.me1<br>
<br>
The DOS ERRORLEVEL flag is not used.<br>
<br>
While Tav_Amp is running, it reports its progress as it analyses the input file 
by displaying information about its actions in a window.<br>
