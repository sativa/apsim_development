Changelog 24/3/98 PdeV.
---------
send_my_variable: reporting grasp_total_cover() as cover_tot sends out 
                  cover from tomorrow's pools, not todays. Changed to
                  g_out_total_cover, which is calculated from today's pool.

send_my_variable: typo in growth_regrow(th)
                  removed runoff_cover. one less kludge.
----------
added SWIM interface:
 New parameters required:
  uptake_source: 'apsim' | 'calc'
  kl2rlv       : conversion factor converting kl to rlv (root 
                 length volume). Can be reset by manager. 
 Use this at your own risk. Pasture growth by transpiration works, if
 you can supply correct kl's and kl2rlv. PdeV (devoil@usq.edu.au) has some initial testing derived from rdc's greenmount dataset that indicates dynamic kl2rlv might be needed.
-------- 
Reporting growth_regrow(th)
A bug was removed in reporting growth_regrowth.
----------
EP facility
Grasp can do Erosion Productivity simulations by increasing N stress as the profile erodes. This means more parameters:

max_n_avail_dist = 0.8  0.15 0.05     ! N distribution over profile
enr_a_coeff = 0.0                     ! enrichment coefficients in N lost
enr_b_coeff = 0.0                     ! in sediment

There is a potential inconsistency in that grasp initially distributes max_n_avail over the whole profile, but as the simulation runs, it only extracts N to the depth of its roots. So, unless your roots penetrate to the bottom of the lowest layer, you should fudge the distribution so that sum(max_n_avail) to root depth is the same as before. For example:

dlayer           = 100      400      500     500    (mm)!  
max_n_avail      = 15                               ()
max_n_avail_dist = 0.7      0.2      0.2      0.0   ()  ! Distribute for 15kg/ha to 750mm depth

ie. sum(distribution) > 1.0 is OK if you know why you're doing it. This will give you _exactly the same_ results as before.
-----------
Fixed fr_intc_radn    (wasn't being used)
Removed latitude      (ditto)
Removed surface_cover (anachronism)
-----------
There's a rdd available.
-----------
 Caveats:
  The dynamic root and N submodels in grasp are still incomplete. 
  Grasp doesn't talk coherently with soiln2.
