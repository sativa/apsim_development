<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">Extra field validation has been added to many areas including, clock, met file and soil. Also more drop down lists of valid options have been added instead of the user entering free text which would often causes errors when running the simulation due to spelling mistakes. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">Soil and met charts have been updated to give more useful information and  the units have been corrected.  </li>
  <li class="style1">Users can now search the summary and output files.</li>
  <li class="style1"> Developers toolbox has been added that gives extra functionality for power users.</li>
  <li class="style1"> A number of bugs to do with renaming/moving/deleting/adding  nodes in the tree have been fix.</li>
  <li class="style1"> A number of bugs to do with shared and shortcut functionality have been fixed.</li>
  <li class="style1">Changes have been made to improve overall speed and reduce memory leakages.</li>
  <li class="style1">The procedure for configuring output file events has been changed and hopefully improved.   </li>

Simulation template. </p>
<p class="Title2">Infrastructure</p>
<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">Even more APSIM infrastructure is  CMP (Common Modelling 
  Protocol) compliant.</p>

<p class="Title2">APSIM wheat model</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="Normal">refinement of the yield and grain protein algorithms has 
    been undertaken.&nbsp;&nbsp; Results of this recent testing on a wide range

<p class="Title2">APSoil</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">APSoil and the soil form in the APSIM User interface has 
undergone numerous changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Texture column added in the Soil Profile tab - will import and 
export this to/from spreadsheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">The &quot;Check soils&quot; button will now check all soils under the 
currently selected node in the tree rather than all soils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">If you modify DUL, then the PAWC columns are now auto updated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">You can export part of a database to a spreadsheet with path 
info. NB: Path info is now part of the &quot;Name&quot; column in the spreadsheet rather 
than a separate column.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Export some soils to see what I mean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">If you double click on a APSRU-????.soils file, APSoil will 
now check the security and ask for a password if necessary. Didn't before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Some bugs dealing with importing from some .par files have 
been fixed. e.g. TAB characters are now tolerated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Can now add and delete soil layers directly in APSoil - this 
fixes Anthony's problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">InitWater and InitNitrogen sometimes crashed APSoil after 
importing from a .par file and spreadsheet</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Two decimal places is now supported for SWCON</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">When importing values from EXCEL, the precision of those 
numbers is truncated to what the user sees in the APSOIL grid. Previously, 
APSoil was hiding unwanted precision which was causing APSIM problems.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">Apsim user interface</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">Look and feel has changed slightly to improve usability.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">The variables grid now handles a blank module name. e.g. you 
  can specify that you want 'sw' as an output but don't need to provide a source 
  module name for the variable.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">The &quot;Shared&quot; mechanism whereby you can share components 
  between paddocks or simulations now works properly.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">The simulation tree no longer repeatedly expands itself when 
  the user drags or modifies something.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">Updated sowing rules in the UI now allow users to select a 
  crop growth stage.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">Climate change component now works properly.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">Font size in Logic and Rule boxes has been increased for 
  readability.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">Added an Operations component.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">Added an Erosion component.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">New manager rules have been added: &quot;Lucerne ley fixed sow 
  harvest at flowering&quot; and &quot;Lucerne ley variable sow harvest at flowering&quot;</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">You can now have an if statement on the very first line of a 
  logic component. Previously this would stop APSIM running.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">APSIM Report</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">New components: ChartLine, Depth, Frequency, RecFilter and 
updated (more consistent) macros</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Plant</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">A defect whereby PLANT would leak P has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">The protein output has been fixed to be a percent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p class="Normal">Prevent phenology being wound back to stage 3 which 
initialises plant parts\</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">Operatns</p>

<p class="Normal">This is a new module for APSIM. It is still under development 
and not recommended for general use.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Infrastructure</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">The APSIM infrastructure is now more CMP (Common Modelling 
Protocol) compliant meaning that APSIM modules now stand a much better chance of 
running in CSIRO Plant Industry's FARMWI$E grazing framework and visa versa.</p>

<p class="Title2">APSFront</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">APSFront has now been removed from the APSIM release and it's 
development has discontinued. It is recommended that all users migrate to the 
APSIM user interface. Introductory training workshops are held every six months 
and show how to use the new user interface to create and run simulations. 
Alternatively, the same exercises and material can be accessed at
<a href="http://www.apsim.info/apsim/Training/Index.htm">
http://www.apsim.info/apsim/Training/Index.htm</a>. These exercises are self 
paced and assume no knowledge of the APSIM user interface.</p>

<p class="Title2">Sorghum</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">A new Sorghum module makes it's debut in this release. No 
changes are required to the control / parameter files to use this new module.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Run-time speed.</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">Some work has been done on APSIM to improve it's runtime 
speed. While APSIM 5 is almost twice as quick as the previous version 4.2, the 
chart below shows that there is still much to be done to improve APSIM's speed.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Title2">
<img border="0" src="runtime%20speed%205.gif" width="753" height="621"></p>

<p class="Normal">This chart shows the amount of time, in seconds, that it took 
for APSIM to run a 50 year continuous wheat simulation on the same hardware i.e. 
the changes to runtime speed are due to software and not improved hardware speed 
over the years.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Apsim user interface</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">Support for complex rotations has been added, similar to the 
way APSFront did rotations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">Grid cell handling has been improved so that 
cut/copy/paste/delete works in the same way as Microsoft Excel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">A new memo/comment facility has been added so that users can 
add comments to their simulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">A new tracker capability has been added so that APSIM 
variables can be summarised e.g. average weekly/monthly rainfall, runoff etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">A new erosion capability has been added.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Normal">Increased stability and a new look.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Title2">Apsoil</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">Improved soil importing and exporting to and from 
  spreadsheet and .par files has been implemented.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="Normal">A new look keeping it in line with the Apsim user interface 
  has been added.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Title2">Screen</p>

<p class="Title2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">The screen module no longer exists. All control files will be 
automatically modified to remove the reference to screen. e.g. lines like the 
following will be deleted.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; module = screen&nbsp;&nbsp; test.par
