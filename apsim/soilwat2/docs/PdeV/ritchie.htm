<H3>The Ritchie evaporation model</H3>

<P>Soil evaporation is assumed to take place in two stages: the constant
and the falling rate stages. In the first stage the soil is sufficiently
wet for water to be transported to the surface at a rate at least equal
to the potential evaporation rate. Potential evapotranspiration is calculated
using an equilibrium evaporation concept as modified by Priestly and Taylor(1972).
Once the water content of the soil has decreased below a threshold value
the rate of supply from the soil will be less than potential evaporation
(second stage evaporation). These behaviours are described in soilwat through
the use of two parameters: U and cona. </P>

<P>The parameter U (as from CERES) represents the amount of cumulative
evaporation before soil supply decreases below atmospheric demand. The
rate of soil evaporation during the second stage is specified as a function
of time since the end of first stage evaporation. The parameter Cona (from
PERFECT) specifies the change in cumulative second stage evaporation against
the square root of time. </P>

<P>i.e.</P>

<CENTER><P>E<SUB>s </SUB>= cona t<SUP>1/2</SUP> </P></CENTER>

<P>Water lost by evaporation is removed from the surface layer of the soil
profile thus this layer can dry below the wilting point or lower limit
(LL) to a specified air-dry water content (air_dry). </P>

<P>SoilWat uses two parameters, U and CONA, to specify soil evaporation.
U (as in CERES) is the amount of cumulative evaporation, since soil wetting,
before soil supply becomes limiting. Subsequently soil evaporation is a
fraction of the square root of time since the end of first stage evaporation,
using the regression coefficient CONA ( from PERFECT). </P>
